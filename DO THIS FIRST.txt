1. add a new div called classSelection or something with the classes inside styled how you want
2. change the current start game click function to show the classSelection div instead of startgame
3. add a new click function that handles clicking on the classes to start the game

- the classSelection div you create should be "display: none" by default so you can fadeIn
- you can duplicate the startGame click function and change the affected id's inside to show a different div
- you can assign a click event to *every* div by using CSS classes, so:
   $(".bert").on("click", function(e) {
  would select every div with the class of bert and give it the same click
