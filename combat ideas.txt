starting hand/max hand draw of 3 cards...

each hero has 3 preset cards...

cards disgard on use (cards might have a use counter for items like shields and torches)

single use items like potions and spells

find a working amount of health pool ..

find the right level of enemy health/armour

find right amount of armour given per items..

figure out how to include dice to combat. (maybe a miss/crit dice, and a d4 attack dice which upgrades to d6etc based on gear)

figure out types of attacks and effects for different monsters and room effects.

heroes get a base attack/dodge based off stats rolled.

weapons types add a dice type to attack rolls ... starting with d4.

if you die the maze fails and you drop some gold... 

you get to visit the shop between mazes..

the goal is to get more gold (gold = highscore)

1-3 levels of maze difficulty to begin with.... level 1 holds grade 1 level treasures/items... level 2 grade 2 etc...



Health Bar HTML:
<div id="healthBar">
    <div class="inner"></div>
</div>

Then give the #healthBar a width and height and position....

Then give the .inner a 100% width and the same height, give this a background colour as well.

That will give us a long bar of a colour of your choice, the reason it's one inside the other, is because we wanna animate the inner one
